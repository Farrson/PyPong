# PyPong

This is a project I have done years ago as a side project in university. Could not find the original code so I remade it. Its just an implementation of the classic game PONG that
can be played as singleplayer angainst a bot or as 2-players using the same keyboard. Player 1 controls the left paddle using the arrow keys (up and down) while the optional
player 2 controls the right paddle using the keys "w" and "s".
